You control a ghost who doesn't know her name, or how she died, but who offers to help a visitor called Pip to learn more about DEATH as part of his research for building a js13kgames entry. Soon the ghost realises it is Pip that is helping her to remember something.

# Controls

Control the ghost by using the Float to, Look at, Listen to, Touch, and Whisper to icons at the bottom of the screen.

**Float to:** Used for moving around, but you can only walk 1 metre from your urn!!

**Look at:** Used for examining an item or something in the current scene.

**Listen to:** Used for listening to an item or something in the current scene.

**Whisper to:** Used for talking to other characters in the game, although your voice may need a little electronic help.
